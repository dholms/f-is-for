on, and the\\nrotor blades start"," i turn and grin at him"," it\u2019s like looking\\nout from inside a fish bowl"," it\u2019s pitch black, not\\neven the moon to shed any light on our journey","

hour before the big reveal","\\ni have a serious case of butterflies","\\ni think he smiles, but it\u2019s difficult to tell in the darkness"," it all sounds very professional to me"," i think

gallery\\nthan a place to live"," i shake my head"," i\u2019m still cold from the wind on the helipad"," i blink at him","\\ni am standing in this enormous room feeling out of place"," i walk over to the glass wall, and i realize\\nthat the lower half of the wall opens concertina-style on to the balcony"," i walk back to the kitchen area \u2013 it takes a few seconds, it\u2019s so far from the

body"," i moan again"," i like that a lot,\u201d\\nhe whispers","\\ni want to stiffen my legs, but i can\u2019t move"," it\u2019s absolutely exquisite"," i moan again, and he moves suddenly"," i taste the saltiness on his thumb and the faint\\nmetallic tang of blood ","\\ni cannot move"," i\u2019m enticingly ensnared by him, and he\u2019s poised and ready to take me once more"," i\\ngroan loudly"," it feels deeper this time, delectable"," i groan again, and he deliberately circles his hips\\nand pulls back, pauses a beat, and then eases his way back in"," it\u2019s driving me insane \u2013 his teasing, deliberately slow thrusts,\\nand the intermittent feeling of fullness is overwhelming"," i\u2019m not sure i can take much more"," i pull my\\nknees up to my chest, utterly spent, and immediately drift off or pass out into an exhausted sleep"," i have no idea how long i\u2019ve slept"," i stretch out beneath the duvet, and i\\nfeel sore, deliciously sore"," i sit up, staring out at the cityscape in\\nfront of me"," i hear the music","\\ni wrap the duvet round me and quietly pad down the corridor toward the big room","\\ni pad quietly toward him, enticed by the sublime, melancholy music"," i\u2019m mesmerized watching his\\nlong skilled fingers as they find and gently press the keys, thinking how those same fingers have\\nexpertly handled and caressed my body"," i flush and gasp at the memory and press my thighs together","\\ni notice now that he\u2019s wearing pj pants"," i can\u2019t fathom his\\nmood"," i flush, embarrassed, pulling the duvet tighter around me"," i realize that i\u2019ve not seen his naked chest before"," instinctively, i\\nreach out to run my fingers through the smattering of dark hair on his chest to see how it feels","\\nimmediately, he steps back out of my reach","\\ni drop my hand and frown"," i don\u2019t think i\u2019ve ever touched his torso"," i climb back onto the bed, trying not to think about the blood"," i stretch out and open my eyes"," it\u2019s a\\nbeautiful may morning, seattle at my feet"," i\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still in bed"," i\\nshake my head, so much to think about"," it\u2019s tempting to reach out and touch him, but like a small child,\\nhe\u2019s so lovely when he\u2019s asleep"," i don\u2019t have to worry about what i\u2019m saying, what he\u2019s saying, what\\nplans he has, especially his plans for me","\\ni could gaze at him all day, but i have needs \u2013 bathroom needs"," i walk through a door thinking that it might be the bathroom, but i\u2019m\\nin a vast walk-in closet as big as my bedroom"," i didn\u2019t think about her all evening"," i was supposed to text her"," i\u2019m going to be in trouble"," i wonder briefly how she\u2019s getting on with elliot"," i try the other door"," it\u2019s the bathroom, and it\u2019s\\nbigger than my bedroom","\\ni stare at myself in the gigantic mirror above the sinks"," i feel a\\nlittle sore, if i\u2019m honest, and my muscles -

am going to have to process all this"," i shudder","\\ni\u2019m bewildered and confused"," i\\ntry and bring order to the chaos with my fingers but fail miserably and give up \u2013 maybe i\u2019ll find hair\\nties in my purse","\\ni\u2019m starving"," i head back out to the bedroom"," i left my purse in christian\u2019s study"," i fetch it and reach for my cell phone"," i have to try and

the same time in my bag and quickly tie my hair in pigtails"," i take my ipod out of the bag and plug my\\nheadphones in"," i slip it into the breast pocket of christian\u2019s\\nshirt, turn it up loud, and start dancing","\\ni am daunted by his kitchen"," it\u2019s so sleek and modern and none of the cupboards have handles"," it takes\\nme a few seconds to deduce that i have to push the cupboard doors to open them"," i check in the fridge, where there are plenty of eggs, and\\ndecide i want pancakes and bacon"," i set about making some batter, dancing my way round the kitchen"," it allows a bit of time to think but not too deeply"," i came here to spend the night in christian grey\u2019s bed, and managed\\nit, even though he doesn\u2019t let anyone in his bed"," i smile, mission accomplished"," i grin"," i\\nignore her, but deep down i know she has a point"," i shake my head to concentrate on the task at hand"," i think i have the hang of it"," i need somewhere to keep the pancakes\\nwarm, and i start on the bacon"," i have never fitted in anywhere and now\u2026 i have an\\nindecent proposal to consider from king misfit himself","\\ni put the bacon under the grill, and while it\u2019s cooking, i whisk some eggs"," i turn, and christian is\\nsitting on one of the bar stools at the breakfast bar, leaning on it, his face supported by his steepled\\nhands","\\ni freeze, flush, then gather myself and pull the headphones out of my ears, my knees weak at the sight\\nof him"," it\u2019s very entertaining","\\ni purse my lips","\\ni turn and continue to whisk the eggs, probably beating them a little harder than they need","\\nin a moment, he\u2019s beside me","\\ni turn back to the task at hand, trying to hide my smile"," i pour the egg mix into a pan, pull out the bacon and turn it over, and put it back\\nunder the grill"," if you have some"," i purse my lips"," i serve up the breakfast onto the heated plates and lay them on the placemats"," i hunt in\\nthe refrigerator and find some maple syrup","\\ni glance up at christian, and he\u2019s waiting for me to sit down"," i climb up and wince slightly as i sit down","\\ni flush"," i think he\u2019s trying to stifle a smile, but i can\u2019t be sure"," i wondered if we should continue your basic training"," i suppress my groan","\\ni try a forkful of omelet but can barely taste it"," it\u2019s very distracting, and i happen to know you\u2019re not wearing anything under\\nmy shirt which makes it even more distracting,\u201d he growls","\\ni dunk my teabag in the small pot that christian has provided"," i cannot tell what he\u2019s thinking"," i glance up at him, trying to recover my equilibrium"," it\u2019s so frustrating"," if that\u2019s okay"," i have to work tomorrow"," i\u2019m not even aware i\u2019ve been biting my lip"," i stare at my half-eaten\\nbreakfast"," i\u2019m just not hungry","\\ni must remember not to put so much on my plate if he\u2019s going to be weird about food"," i note that he cleans his plate"," it\u2019s\\nkate"," i roll my eyes at the expectation in her voice"," i\u2019ve signed a damned agreement"," i need a plan"," i head back to watch christian move gracefully around his\\nkitchen"," i flush"," i can\u2019t ask you"," i\u2019ll get your biased, kinky-as-hell,\\ndistorted world-view regarding sex"," i want an impartial opinion"," i won\u2019t\\nmention the red room of pain","\\ni\u2019d really rather you didn\u2019t"," it\u2019s none of their business"," i squirm inwardly"," i cannot lie to\\nthis man","\\ni inhale sharply"," it foams as\\nthe bath fills and smells of sweet sultry jasmine","\\ni\u2019m standing in the doorway, wide-eyed and wary, my arms wrapped around myself"," i step forward\\nwhile surreptitiously admiring his physique"," i take his hand, and he bids me to step into the bath while i am\\nstill wearing his shirt"," i do as i\u2019m told"," i\u2019ll have to get used to it if i\u2019m going to take him up on his\\noutrageous offer\u2026 if! the water is enticingly hot"," i do as i\u2019m bid"," i nod frantically "," i had no idea i could\\naf ect him so"," i\u2019m naked for heaven\u2019s sake"," i

and his head is cocked to one side"," i could just reach up and touch him"," i lie back and briefly close my eyes, relaxing in the soothing warmth"," i gasp in surprise"," i am naked, in a bath with christian grey"," if someone had told me i\u2019d be doing this when i woke up in his hotel suite yesterday, i\\nwould not have believed them"," i groan"," i\u2019m so glad kate insisted\\ni shave","

in a sexual thrall to this\\nman, and he doesn\u2019t let me move"," i need washing, too,\u201d he murmurs"," i\u2019m very attached to this"," i glance\\nup at him and come face to face with his wicked grin"," i\\nrealize that i\u2019m staring"," i swallow","\\ni smile at him and reach for the body wash, squirting some soap onto my hand"," i do as he\u2019s done,\\nlathering the soap in my hands until they are foamy"," i do not take my eyes off his"," i reach forward and place one of my hands around him, mirroring how\\nhe\u2019s holding himself"," i squeeze, and\\nhe places his hand over mine"," i remember him pushing his thumb in my\\nmouth and asking me to suck, hard"," i lean\\nforward, while he has his eyes closed, and place my lips around him and tentatively suck, running my\\ntongue over the tip"," i can do\\nthis"," i can fuck him with my mouth"," i twirl my tongue around the tip again, and he flexes his hips"," i feel his legs tense beneath my hands"," i suck harder, flicking my tongue across the head of his\\nimpressive erection"," i suck\\nharder and harder, pushing him deeper and deeper, swirling my tongue round and round"," i can do this"," i push even harder and, in a moment of\\nextraordinary confidence, i bare my teeth"," it tips him over the edge"," i swallow quickly"," i sit back and watch him, a triumphant, gloating smile tugging at the corners of my lips","\\ni long to reach round and embrace him\u2026 touch him\u2026 but he has my arms trapped in the towel"," i\u2019m\\nsoon lost in his kiss","\\ni frown, not understanding","\\nin his bedroom, he stares down at me as we stand by his bed"," i nod, wide-eyed with the sudden realization that i do trust him","\\ni do as he asks, and he binds my wrists together with his tie, knotting it firmly"," it\u2019s secure"," instinctively, i move back until i\\nfeel the bed against the back of my knees"," i\u2019m mesmerized by his tongue as it\\nsweeps slowly over his upper lip"," i groan","\\ni want to touch him"," i move my hands and rather awkwardly, given i\u2019m restrained, feel his hair","\\nit\u2019s too erotic"," i\u2019m going to combust"," i squeeze my eyes

out","\\ni flush scarlet, everywhere, feeling faint, and i instantly close my eyes"," i can\u2019t watch him do that!\\nhe blows gently up the length of my sex"," i\u2019m losing all sense of\\nself,

me","\\ni open my eyes, and i\u2019m draped in christian grey"," i take a\\nmoment to absorb that he\u2019s still in my bed and fast asleep, and it\u2019s light outside \u2013 morning"," i become\\naware of his erection against my hip","\\ni flush, but then i feel seven shades of scarlet from his heat","\\ni flush some more","\\ni nod, staring up at him, and i realize that i\u2019ve

on","\\ni am at work"," i will email you when i get home","\\ni wasn\u2019t wrong when i said you were the ultimate consumer","\\ni put the thing in my back pocket, hating it already"," it buzzes once against my behind\u2026 how apt, i think ironically, but summoning all my\\nwillpower, i ignore it","\\nin that moment, three weeks of \u2013 exams, graduation, intense, fucked-up billionaires,

ago sat at the piano in\\nhis huge living room and the unbearable bittersweet melancholy of the music he was playing"," i want his proximity"," i\u2019m an in-the-moment kind of guy","\\ni roll my eyes at the pair of them"," it\u2019s a compulsory family dinner tonight","\\ni stand and make my way over to the kitchen area on the pretense of unpacking one of the crates"," it\u2019s\\nall solid

silent\\nand floored, they are so rare"," i take a brief and luxurious moment to enjoy it","\\ni wake early to a gray sunday morning after a surprisingly refreshing night\u2019s sleep and lie awake\\nstaring at my crates","\\ni roll my eyes at his bossiness, but his last line makes me smile"," i head for the bathroom, wondering if\\nelliot made it back last night and trying hard to rein in my nerves","\\ni can drive the audi in high-heels! at 12:55 p"," i check my seldom-worn mascara in the light up vanity mirror on my sunshield","\\nin the infinity mirrors of the elevator, i check out my plum dress, well \u2013 kate\u2019s plum dress"," i\u2019m wearing the underwear that taylor\\nbought for me"," i flush at the thought of his buzz-cut roaming the aisles of agent provocateur

paper"," i check\\nthe caption","\\ni laugh"," i\u2019d forgotten","\\ni nod"," i believe elliot is asking kate\\ntoo"," i don\u2019t know how you feel about that"," it will be odd for me to introduce

closed door and head back downstairs to the art gallery that is\\nchristian\u2019s living room"," is she giving him\\nsome kind of not so subtle warning? christian recovers himself"," in fact, he

lashes"," i don\u2019t want to punish you right now"," if you\u2019d caught me yesterday\\nevening, well, that would have been a different story"," it\u2019s very simple"," i should run, but i can\u2019t"," i\u2019m drawn to\\nhim on some deep, elemental level, that i can\u2019t begin to understand"," i\u2019m really going to do this"," it\u2019s a heady, potent cocktail"," i nod, my mouth dry, my heart thumping for a way out of my chest","\\ni swallow, and rather clumsily, i take them off"," i want you to be comfortable with your body,\\nanastasia","\\nit is a joy to behold"," in fact, i could gaze at you all day, and i want you unembarrassed and unashamed\\nof your nakedness","\\ni moan","\\ni do as i\u2019m bid, my breathing shallow, fear and longing mixed together"," it\u2019s an intoxicating mix","\\ni should be taking notes if he wants me to remember"," it\u2019s only just not painful","\\ni\u2019m on my knees, waiting"," i have no idea\\nhow long he leaves me like this\u2026 a few minutes, five, ten? my breathing becomes shallower, the\\nanticipation is devouring me from the inside out"," it happens so quickly that the surprise hardly registers","\\ni blink at him, confused"," i succeed"," is it really not going to hurt?\\n\u201ci mean it,\u201d he says"," it\u2019s brown\\nplaited leather"," it\u2019s singularly the most exciting and scary thing\\ni\u2019ve ever done"," i\u2019m entrusting myself to a beautiful man who, by his own admission, is fifty shades of\\nfucked-up"," i suppress the brief thrill of fear"," i\u2019m staring at his chest"," i want to\\nrun my nose and tongue through that smattering of chest hair","\\ni could just lean forward\u2026\\nhe steps back and gazes at me, his expression hooded, salacious, carnal, and i am helpless, my hands\\ntied, but just looking at his lovely face, reading his need and longing for me, i can feel the dampness\\nbetween my legs"," i like\\nthat"," i cry out in surprise as all my\\nnerve endings stand to attention"," i pull against the restraints"," i know where this is leading, and i try and psyche myself up for it \u2013 but when he\\nhits my clitoris, i cry out loudly","\\ni did not expect this to be like this\u2026 i am lost"," i can taste the rich leather and the saltiness\\nof my arousal"," i dissolve in his embrace, my head against his chest, and\\ni\u2019m mewling and whimpering as the aftershocks of my orgasm consume me"," i feel the build up again","\\ni lose all sense of self"," if i had the strength, i\u2019d touch him, but i don\u2019t"," i can barely keep my eyes open"," i am utterly spent and\\nfighting an overwhelming desire to sleep"," i\u2019m leaning against his chest, my eyes are closed, and he\u2019s\\nwrapped around me \u2013 arms and legs \u2013 and i feel\u2026 safe, and oh so comfortable"," i open my eyes\\nand glance up at him","\\ni flush and look back at his chest in longing"," i want to run my tongue through the hair, kiss him, and for\\nthe first time, i notice he has a few random and faint small, round scars dotted around his chest","\\ni stumble clumsily up into a standing position and scoot over to the door and kneel as instructed"," i\u2019m\\nshaky and very, very tired, monumentally confused","\\ni climb warily to my feet"," i do as i\u2019m told"," i gape up at him as\\nadrenaline spikes though my body anew"," i notice now that it has dark red\\nsheets on it and a shackle at each corner","\\ni frown"," if you do, i\u2019ll spank you"," i\u2019m not thinking of sleep now","\\ni stifle my moan as i feel my whole body respond, coming alive once more for him","\\ni grip harder round the post and push back against him as he continues his merciless onslaught, again\\nand again, his fingers digging into my hip","\\ni giggle and rub my wrists as they\u2019re freed"," i feel his grin"," i wish momentarily that i were more\\nawake to really appreciate him"," i don\u2019t have the strength to lift my arms","\\ni am exhausted"," i don\u2019t remember ever being this tired"," i moan and burrow into my pillow","\\ni open my eyes reluctantly"," it\u2019s dusk outside"," i\u2019ll be downstairs","\\ni\u2019m refreshed but suddenly nervous"," it will be kate\u2019s first time meeting them too \u2013 at least she\u2019ll be there for support"," i\\nroll my shoulders","\\ni climb slowly out of bed and note that my dress is hanging outside the wardrobe and my bra is on the\\nchair"," i flush at the memory, after he, i can\u2019t even bring myself to think\\nabout it, he was so \u2013 barbarous"," i frown"," i remove the braid\\nand hastily brush out my hair, i then glance down at the drink he\u2019s left","\\nit\u2019s pale pink"," i never figured you for a sinatra fan"," i place my hand in\\nhis","\\ni put my free hand on his shoulder and grin up at him, caught in his infectious, playful mood"," if that\u2019s the way you want to play it, miss steele"," i fear that it may be at my expense"," in the relative safety of his apartment, it seemed like a fun, teasing idea"," i\u2019m grateful that kate\u2019s plum dress is so\\nclingy and hangs to the top of my knees"," i have no special skills"," i smile involuntarily as i recall being in his arms as he\\nspun me around his living room, so unexpected, and he has my panties, somewhere"," i rub my wrists reflexively \u2013 thin strips of plastic will do that\\nto a girl","\\ni realize, in that moment, that i hate her"," i hope that i never meet her because i will not be responsible\\nfor my actions if i do"," i can\u2019t remember ever feeling this passionately about anyone, especially\\nsomeone i\u2019ve never met"," i want to be with him"," i reach the\\nconclusion that she rarely uses her brain to think but another vital part of her anatomy, and at the\\nmoment, it\u2019s a rather exposed part","\\ni frown and turn to look at him"," i blink up at him and smile shyly"," i ask a question\\nthat\u2019s been bugging me"," i know they\u2019re quite\\nbrutal, and i do like that in a restraining device"," i stare out of the window and the\\nlandscape has changed","\\ni glance briefly at christian, and he\u2019s staring at me","\\ni sigh and frown","\\nit is just before eight when the audi draws into the driveway of a colonial-style mansion","\\nit\u2019s breathtaking, even down to the roses around the door","\\ni nod, and he gives my hand another reassuring squeeze","\\ni flush"," i\u2019d forgotten my missing panties"," i scowl at christian who grins broadly as i turn and climb out\\nof the car"," i glance nervously at christian"," it\u2019s a revelation"," i can\u2019t help but smile at her boundless enthusiasm"," it\u2019s all dark wood floors and\\nantique rugs with a sweeping staircase to the second floor","\\ni glimpse christian rolling his eyes, and i raise an eyebrow at him","\\ni frown at their exchange"," it\u2019s unnerving"," i\u2019ll get them","\\ni flush scarlet, and seeing kate sitting with elliot, it occurs to me suddenly that the only reason\\nchristian invited me is because kate is here"," i frown at the\\nthought","\\ni haven\u2019t mentioned this to him"," it will depend how my interviews go tomorrow"," i go to follow, but christian\\nclutches my elbow, bringing me to an abrupt halt"," i glare at him"," it\u2019s\\nstunning","\\ni peek up at christian, and he turns to look at me, his head cocked to one side","\\ni flush, and christian glares at her in a butt-out-of-this-kavanagh

delicious \u2013 chorizo and scallops with roasted red peppers and shallots, sprinkled with flat\\nleafed parsley"," i flush as i realize it\u2019s the physical effort of this afternoon that\u2019s given me such an appetite"," if only people would get their kids vacci-nated"," i haven\u2019t signed that\\ncontract yet","\\ni\u2019m grateful for her question, distracting me from my discordant thoughts, and i tell her about our\\nmove","\\nit\u2019s almost embarrassing to witness"," i flush and shift, trying to pull away from him"," i reach for my wine, in desperation"," it is\\neven more palatable since christian manages to retain his good-humor for the rest of the meal"," i\\nsuspect that it\u2019s because i\u2019m eating so heartily"," i glance up at kate, and she\u2019s hanging on every word elliot says, her eyes glowing with lust\\nor love"," i haven\u2019t quite worked out which yet"," i flush just\\nwatching them","\\ni sigh and peek up at fifty shades"," i blush at the direction of my thoughts"," i can see him smirk","\\ni know i\u2019m meant to say yes, but i don\u2019t trust him"," i place my hand in his, and i feel all the muscles clench deep in my belly,\\nresponding to his dark, hungry gray gaze","\\nit is so picturesque, so peaceful"," i stand and gape for a moment"," i need to take my shoes off"," i squeal loudly with\\nshocked surprise, and he gives me a ringing slap on my behind","\\ni hang on to his hips as i\u2019m tipped upside-down, and he strides purposefully in the moonlight across\\nthe lawn"," it\u2019s decorated with a nautical new\\nengland theme: navy blues and creams with a dash of red"," i don\u2019t have time to examine my surroundings \u2013 my\\neyes can\u2019t leave him"," i am mesmerized\u2026 watching him like one would watch a rare and dangerous\\npredator, waiting for him to strike"," i could spontaneously combust from his look alone","\\nit\u2019s a curious mixture of soft and prickly"," i love\\nhis hair"," it\u2019s a heady mix"," i swallow instinctively"," i\u2019m mad because you went drinking with that\\nguy who tried to seduce you when you were drunk and who left you when you were ill with an almost\\ncomplete stranger"," i suppress my moan","\\ni place my hands on my head, and i know it\u2019s so i won\u2019t touch him"," i\u2019m so turned on","\\ni feel my hips moving already up to meet him \u2013 wanting him inside me, like this \u2013 rough and hard"," i groan loudly, gutturally, and revel in the fullness of his\\npossession"," i am trapped"," i mustn\u2019t come"," i\u2019m not ready to let him go, my\\nbody craving relief, but he\u2019s so heavy, and in that moment, i can\u2019t push against him"," i want you frustrated","\\ni nod, panting"," i gaze at him, my breathing still erratic, and involuntarily i squeeze my thighs together, trying\\nto find some relief"," i don\u2019t grin as i take them from him, but inside i\\nknow \u2013 i\u2019ve taken a punishment fuck but gained a small victory over the panties","\\ni purse my lips","\\ni flush","\\ni put my hand into his, and he gives it a soft squeeze"," i blush scarlet"," i\\ngasp in surprise","\\ni\u2019m fully aware that her actions come from a good place, but sometimes she just oversteps the mark,\\nand right now so far that she\u2019s into the neighboring state"," i scowl at her, and she pokes her tongue out\\nat me, making me smile unwillingly","\\ni flush, and christian rolls his eyes again"," i purse my lips"," i surreptitiously watch their interaction"," it\u2019s obvious grace\\nadores him with a mother\u2019s unconditional love"," i do hope we see you again, very soon, ana","\\ni feel some of the tension leaving my shoulders"," i am exhausted, physically and\\nemotionally"," i gaze at christian, and he\u2019s staring at me","\\ni flounder momentarily"," if i hadn\u2019t wanted you to meet them, you wouldn\u2019t be here"," is that how you\\nwere feeling the whole time you were there?\u201d\\noh! he wanted me there \u2013 and it\u2019s a revelation"," i glance nervously at taylor"," i thought that","\\ni shrug, trapped"," i don\u2019t want to lose him"," in spite of all his

unbuckle my seatbelt, reach across, and clamber into his lap, taking him\\ncompletely by surprise"," i\u2019ll sign your contract","\\ni nuzzle up against him, eyes closed, my nose at his throat,

his chest\\nbut just snuggle in his arms as he holds me tightly"," i have assumed he\u2019d like me to sleep with him, and then i remember\\nthat he doesn\u2019t sleep with anyone, although he has with me a few times","\\ni frown, and abruptly his gaze darkens"," i melt against him, and my\\nbreathing stops as my insides unfurl with longing"," i reciprocate, fastening my teeth over his top lip,\\nteasing him, and he groans"," i\u2019ve had enough exotic for one day"," i may have to subdue it some way","\\ni oblige, and in one breathtakingly swift move, he removes my dress like a magician, grasping it at the\\nhem and pulling it smoothly and fleetly over my head","\\ni giggle and applaud politely"," i catch\\nit, bemused","\\ni frown but decide to humor him"," i leave my panties on, i haven\u2019t worn them for most of the\\nevening","\\ni stare at myself in the over-large mirror, shocked that i still look the same"," i ignore her, but she won\u2019t climb back into her box"," i scowl at my reflection"," i need to be able\\nto show him affection \u2013 then perhaps he can reciprocate","\\ni shake my head resigned and grasp christian\u2019s toothbrush"," i\u2019m\\nrushing him"," i just hope neither of us falls off in our attempt to do so"," i finish with his toothbrush, rinse it off, and\\nhand it to him, my look never leaving his"," i smirk back at

the same","\\ni fumble in my purse for the packet"," i hate condoms"," i don\u2019t believe it","\\nit\u2019s 8:30 a"," it smells of sweet batter, fried food, and disinfec-tant"," it\\nwas our secret"," i pick up a menu and examine it"," i realize i\u2019m starving","\\ni glance up at him, and he\u2019s staring at me in that way that tightens all the muscles in my belly and takes\\nmy breath away, his eyes dark and smoldering"," i gaze at him, my blood singing in my veins\\nanswering his call","\\ni swallow, praying that i don\u2019t go the same color as poor leandra"," it cuts

you friday"," i\u2019ll send taylor to collect you from\\nthe airport if i can\u2019t come myself"," i hope you sort out your situation","\\ni gaze at my mom"," i think about\\nchristian, and my ridiculous grin refuses to subside"," it keeps creeping across my face, unbidden and\\ndisconcerting, as i recall our various conversations and what we did\u2026 what he did"," i could have landed in her soup or on her wine glass and choked her"," i fervently hope so","\\ni am sweltering in this damned heat"," i need another dip in the pool"," i have heard nothing from christian"," i am starting to worry"," i don\u2019t want to cause\\nyou any worry, it\u2019s heart warming to know that you care for me"," i am thinking of you too and as ever\\nlooking forward to seeing you tomorrow","\\ni sigh, christian is back to formality"," in fact \u2013 you probably misheard me"," i clamber into bed and lie\\nglaring at the ceiling as my eyes adjust to the dark"," i hear another ping from my computer"," i am not\\ngoing to look"," i hope he doesn\u2019t turn into a frog"," i hate leaving her"," i hug bob, and turning, head\\nto the gate \u2013 i do not have time for the first class lounge today"," i will myself not to glance back"," i can no longer hold mine back"," i put my head down and proceed to the gate, keeping\\nmy eyes on the shiny, white floor, blurred through my watery tears"," it is always\\npainful to wrench myself away from mom\u2026 she is scatty, disorganized, but newly insightful, and she\\nloves me"," i frown at my wayward\\nthoughts, and pulling out my blackberry, stare at it despondently"," i frown"," it\u2019s true, and in a moment of startling clarity, i see it"," it\u2019s very simple: i want\\nhis love"," i need christian grey to love me"," i\\nrecall his self-loathing, her love being the only form he found \u2013 acceptable"," i shudder as i remember that i\\nmay have divulged too much"," i am counting the minutes until i see\\nyou this evening, and perhaps torturing the truth out of you about my nocturnal admissions"," it sounds clipped and formal, not his usual witty, pithy style"," i\\nmeant what i said about punishments","\\ni want you safely home"," i sit back, glancing up at the locker where my bags are stowed"," i\\nmanaged this morning, with my mother\u2019s help, to buy christian a small gift to say thank you for first\\nclass and for the gliding"," i smile at the memory of the soaring \u2013\\nthat was something else"," i don\u2019t know yet if i\u2019ll give my silly gift to him"," i am both eager to return and apprehensive of what awaits\\nme at my journey\u2019s end"," i shake my head as the thought\\ncrosses my mind that christian might have purchased the adjacent seat so that i couldn\u2019t talk to\\nanyone"," i dismiss the idea as ridiculous \u2013 no one could be that controlling, that jealous, surely"," i close\\nmy eyes as the plane taxis towards the runway","\\ni emerge into the sea-tac arrivals terminal eight hours later to find taylor waiting and holding up a\\nboard that reads miss a steele"," i remember, though i would like to erase it from my memory, that this man has\\nbought me underwear"," in fact \u2013 and the thought unsettles me \u2013 he\u2019s the only man who\u2019s ever bought me\\nunderwear"," i clamber in, wondering if wearing such a short skirt for the return to seattle was a good\\nidea"," it was cool and welcome in georgia","\\ni can bear the silence no longer"," i begin to think that taylor\u2019s recent\\nslip, when he told me that christian had been hell on wheels, was an anom-aly"," it is so strange not to be met by taylor"," in the great room, christian is on his blackberry talking quietly as he\\nstares out of the glass doors at the early evening seattle skyline"," i stand\\nparalyzed as he closes the distance between us, devouring me with his eyes"," it\u2019s dark and\\nsensual and alarming all at the same time"," i kiss him back with equal fervor, my fingers twisting and\\nfisting in his hair"," it\u2019s very short,\u201d he says, his voice low","\\ni am rendered speechless by the look of hunger in his eyes"," i mirror his actions and step out of my black flats"," i feel the\\ncool, smooth tiled wall at my back as he pushes himself against me so that i\u2019m flattened between his\\nheat and the chill of the ceramic"," i groan loudly, feeling his tongue circling my clitoris"," it\u2019s exquisite, the intensity of feeling \u2013 it\u2019s almost painful","\\ni do as i\u2019m told and wrap my arms around his neck, and he moves quickly and sharply, filling me"," i feel overdressed"," it really is a much\\nnicer way to travel"," i know there are four publishing companies in seattle \u2013 so i am assuming it\u2019s one of them"," it feels heavenly, washing off the sticky georgia morning and the stickiness\\nfrom our lovemaking","\\ni steel myself with a deep breath"," i have emphasized the word \u2018friend"," i\\npout at the wall as he caresses my back with soap"," i\u2019m going to take you again,\u201d he murmurs in my ear as he grabs\\nmy hips, and i know that the discussion is over"," i have plans for\\nyou this evening"," i want you ready and waiting in my playroom in fifteen minutes"," incidentally, the walk-in closet is now full of clothes for you"," i\\ndon\u2019t want any arguments about them"," i sit on the bar stool,\\nmomentarily stupefied, trying to assimilate this morsel of information"," i roll\\nmy eyes in an exaggerated fashion knowing full well he can\u2019t see me"," i ignore her and make my way upstairs toward my room\\nso, it is still mine\u2026 why? i thought he\u2019d agreed to let me sleep with him","\\ni suppose he\u2019s not used to sharing his personal space, but then, neither am i"," i console myself with the\\nthought that at least i have somewhere to escape from him"," i wonder briefly if mrs"," i\u2019ll\\nask her"," i open the closet door and close it again quickly"," it\\nresembles kate\u2019s \u2013 so many clothes hanging neatly on the rail"," i have\\nno idea, no one to compare him too"," it\u2019s right for christian"," it\u2019s what he wants \u2013 and after the last few days\u2026 after all\\nhe\u2019s done, i have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs"," i\u2019d do almost anything to see that look again"," i press my\\nthighs together at the delicious memory, and it reminds me that i need to spread my knees"," i shuffle\\nthem apart"," i glance quickly around the subtly lit room; the cross, the table, the couch, the\\nbench\u2026 that bed"," it looms so large, and it\u2019s made up with red satin sheets"," i glance down quickly, staring at\\nmy hands, positioned with care on my spread thighs"," i indulge myself in a quick glimpse at him, and my heart\\nalmost lurches to a stop"," i lick my lips instinctively"," i can see\\nhis naked feet, and i want to kiss every inch of them\u2026 run my tongue over his instep, suck each of his\\ntoes","\\ni keep my head down, conscious that he\u2019s staring at me while i am practically naked"," i feel the flush\\nas it slowly spreads over my face"," it is his dom gaze \u2013 cold,\\nhard, and sexy as hell, seven shades of sin in one enticing look","\\ni frown slightly at his question, and his face hardens perceptibly"," i blink rapidly, chastened"," intense? wow"," i am mystified"," in his right hand is a flogger"," i remember the name from my first introduction to this room"," it has many long fronds, all soft suede with small\\nbeads at the end"," it will not hurt, but it will bring your blood to the surface of your skin and make you\\nvery sensitive"," i step unsteadily out of them, supporting myself on the ornate post of the bed"," i want him already"," i am too\\nconsumed with anticipation"," i just know my face is completely immobile, my eyes huge, as i gaze at\\nhim"," it has a strange antenna device as well\\nheadphones"," i frown as i try to figure this out"," i can still hear him, though the sound is muffled as he rises\\nfrom the bed"," i\u2019m deafened by my own breathing \u2013 it\u2019s shallow and erratic, reflecting my excitement"," i hear him move slowly round to the other side, takes my right arm\\nand cuffs it","\\ni comply, and he drags me down the bed so that my arms are stretched out and almost straining at the\\ncuffs"," i groan"," it\u2019s so unnerving that i\\ncan\u2019t see him"," i listen hard\u2026 what\u2019s he doing? and i hear nothing, just my breathing and the pounding\\nthud of my heart as blood pulses furiously against my eardrums"," it\u2019s so\\nunexpected"," it\u2019s fur!\\na fur glove?\\nchristian trails his hand, unhurried and deliberate, down to my belly, circling my navel, then carefully\\nfrom hip to hip, and i\u2019m trying to anticipate where he\u2019s going next\u2026 but the music\u2026 it\u2019s in my\\nhead\u2026 transporting me\u2026 the fur across the line of my pubic hair\u2026\\nbetween my legs, along my thighs, down one leg\u2026 up the other\u2026 it almost tickles\u2026 but not quite\u2026\\nmore voices join\u2026 the heavenly choir all singing different parts, their voices blending blissfully and\\nsweetly together in a melodic harmony that is beyond anything i\u2019ve ever heard"," i catch one word --\\n\u2018deus\u2019-- and i realize they are singing in latin"," it takes me by surprise, and it doesn\u2019t exactly hurt, but tingles all over, and he\\nhits me again"," i\u2019ve entered a\\nvery dark, carnal place"," i am lost"," i throw my head back and cry out as i\\nalmost detonate into orgasm\u2026 i\u2019m on the brink, and he stops"," i pull my leg to the middle of the bed\u2026 resting it against him"," i am arched, resting on my shoulders"," i groan as\\nmy hand is freed"," i blink in the dim soft light and stare up into his intense gray gaze"," i am so tired","\\ni groan loudly \u2013 he has such strong, knowing fingers"," i may have to torture it out of you"," i think i\u2019ve just fallen down some stairs in a dream, and i bolt upright, momentarily\\ndisorientated"," it is dark, and i\u2019m in christian\u2019s bed alone"," i glance over at the alarm clock on his bedside"," it is 5:00 in the morning, but i feel rested"," in georgia"," i clamber out of bed, grateful for whatever it is that has woken me"," i can hear faint notes\\nfrom the piano"," i love watching him play"," i hesitate,\\nwatching from the shadows, not wanting to interrupt him"," i want to hold him","\\ni move cautiously toward him, drawn as the moth to the flame\u2026 the idea makes me smile","\\ni can tell he\u2019s pre-occupied with something","\\ni ignore his facial expression and very bravely sit down beside him on the piano stool, placing my\\nhead on his bare shoulder to watch his deft, agile fingers caress the keys"," in e minor, if you\u2019re interested,\u201d he murmurs"," i feel the movement of his hands in his shoulder as i lean\\nagainst him and close my eyes"," it is a hauntingly beautiful piece, sadder even than the chopin, and i lose myself to the\\nbeauty of the lament"," i gaze back impassively as my insides clench\\nand melt under his knowing look"," i gape at him quizzically"," i want you to follow the spirit of the contract in the playroom, and yes, i\\nwant you to follow the rules \u2013 all the time"," i\u2019ll have to find a way to persuade you"," i need some distance","\\ni shake my head amused, and before i realize it, i roll my eyes at him","\\ni swallow instinctively and a frisson of exhilaration runs through me"," i have never been so grateful for its existence than in this moment"," i manage to escape,\\nputting the table between us"," i\u2019m a child again, though that\u2019s not right"," i watch him carefully as he paces\\ndeliberately toward me"," i inch away"," i repeat this as a mantra"," i feel about punishment the way you feel about me touching you"," i frown"," it doesn\u2019t affect me quite as much as that, but it gives you an idea,\u201d i murmur, staring anxiously\\nat him"," i feel ambivalent about it"," i don\u2019t like it, but i don\u2019t hate it"," i don\u2019t"," i couldn\u2019t bear to lose you"," it takes me completely by surprise, and i sense his panic and desperate need in his kiss"," i can soothe him"," i want to know how bad it can get"," i said i would"," if i do this for him, maybe he will let me touch\\nhim"," i\u2019m trying to work this out"," if i can handle this, then maybe you \u2013\u201d my words fail me, and his eyes widen again"," i can do this"," i bend over the smooth soft leather","\\nin a quiet part of my brain, i\u2019m vaguely surprised that he hasn\u2019t made me take it off"," i am going to hit you six times,\\nand you will count with me"," i roll my\\neyes, knowing full well he can\u2019t see me"," i was running to avoid this"," if he\u2019d opened his arms, i\u2019d run to him,\\nnot away from him"," i hear it in his tone, in the\\nway he places his fingers on my back, holding me \u2013 and the atmosphere in the room changes","\\ni close my eyes, bracing myself for the blow"," it comes hard, snapping across my backside, and the\\nbite of the belt is everything i feared"," i cry out involuntarily, and take a huge gulp of air"," it feels so good to scream","\\ni don\u2019t want to cry"," it angers me that i am crying"," i straighten and stare at him, and he\u2019s watching me as
